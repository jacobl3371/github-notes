### Git
Version-control software created by linux creator. 

### Github
Utilization of Git. Web-service with projects that have version-control.

### Repository
A respository is one entire project containing all of the files associated with each other. The essential/most simple file when creating a webpage is the README.md file

### Commit
One saved version of a file. Has a unique identifier. Git allows you to make further changes to your file and then revert one change without reverting the other, wheras google docs is only based on the timestamp of the version, so all changes are lost when going back to an earlier version.
